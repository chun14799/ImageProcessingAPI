In my project. I use 5 scripts :

npm run build : to build the code before run.

npm run start : to run the codde.

npm run test : to clean, build and run jasmine test.

npm run lint : to check if there is anything is not cleared in the code.

npm run clean : to use prettier to format the code

Here is an endpoint is always return status 200 : /api/ , /api/images

Image that can use for resizing is in folder : /src/images/full
